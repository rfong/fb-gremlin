Anti Facebook tag abuse Chrome extension
=====

Quickly slapped this together as a non-malignant deterrent to Chris Peterson's Facebook tag spamnation.

Kind of janky; relies on CSS selectors, so if Facebook's UI changes this will also stop working. Also only thoroughly tested in the status posting box. It works for certain cases of inline tagging in comments, and not very well in wall posts.
